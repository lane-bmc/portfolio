I've done freelance work for a variety of clients including Carnarvon Community School, Vanvero, and Richmond Chinese Alliance Church. Right now, I'm working with <a href="http://www.startupstorm.org/">StartupStorm</a>, doing branding work for their nwHacks Hackathon.</p><p>I'm a Christian and an avid musician, part of an identity that has driven me to work with integrity and excellence. I strive to use my design expertise to honestly and creatively meet real needs in the world. This is what I love to do.</p><h3>What Does He Do?</h3><h4>Branding + Identity</h4><p>Everything about a brand, including its voice, values, culture, and visual representations, must be well-aligned. I help brands develop their unique, consistent identity, doing everything from brand definition to logo design to print and web collateral.</p><h4>Graphic Design</h4><p>I love working with visuals, even if it's not for a branding-specific project. Some of my other graphic design work has included user interfaces, posters, business cards, and even wedding pins!</p><h4>UX Design</h4><p>Sketching, wireframing, user testing, and rapid prototyping are all tools of my trade. Every project I work on is driven by a desire for great user experience - users should effortlessly be able to accomplish what they came to do.</p><h3>How Do I Get In Touch With Him?</h3><p>If you're itching to see what we can accomplish together, <a href="contact.html">let's talk</a>!</p></div></div></section><footer><div class="container"><div class="col-2of3 col-1of2-sm"><p>Made with love, semantic code, and IE9+ support.
