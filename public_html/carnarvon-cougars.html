My job consisted of two large tasks - <strong>redesign Carnarvon Community School's logo</strong>, and <strong>brand a new school and community engagement program</strong>. I worked closely with Colin Chan, a teacher from Carnarvon Community School, at multiple points throughout the design process to ensure that my work stayed true to the vibrant Carnarvon Community School spirit.</p></section><section class="section-project-details"><h3>The Logo</h3><blockquote>I'd like to have the logo printed on a purple base in dark yellow and maroon similar to the current colour scheme. I'd like to make the logo more aggressive.<br><cite>Colin Chan, Carnarvon Community School teacher, on the design requirements for the logo</cite></blockquote><p>The old logo was a cartoony cougar halfheartedly waving a flag. I was tasked with bringing energy to the logo while staying true to the cougar mascot and the original yellow-and-maroon colour scheme. I decided to create a more angular, geometric face for the cougar, for a more aggressive look.</p><p>I subtly increased the vibrancy of the colour palette while still conforming to the classic yellow-and-maroon. Finally, I changed the font to <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/25541553/Ailerons-free-typeface">Ailerons</a>, a taller, more angular font that emphasized the cougar's aggressiveness. Every choice added up to a far more vicious, ready-to-pounce cougar that better represented the school's vibrancy.</p><figure class="container project-image"><div class="col-2of3"><a href="img/carnarvon-cougars/carnarvon-cougars-old-logo.jpg"><img src="img/carnarvon-cougars/carnarvon-cougars-old-logo.jpg" alt="The old Carnarvon Community School logo, featuring a cartoon cougar waving a flag encircled by the words 'Carnarvon Cougars'."></a></div><figcaption><div class="col-1of3"><h4>Carnarvon Cougars Old Logo</h4><p>This cartoony cougar didn't match the dynamic vibrancy of Carnarvon Community School. And yes, this was the highest resolution file that existed.</p></div></figcaption></figure><figure class="container project-image"><div class="col-2of3"><a href="img/carnarvon-cougars/carnarvon-cougars-new-logo.png"><img src="img/carnarvon-cougars/carnarvon-cougars-new-logo.png" alt="The new Carnarvon Community School logo, featuring a vicious cougar encircled by the words 'Carnarvon Cougars'."></a></div><figcaption><div class="col-1of3"><h4>Carnarvon Cougars New Logo</h4><p>The new logo utilizes a more aggressive depiction of a cougar, more vibrant colours, and a more angular typeface to express the school's high energy.</p></div></figcaption></figure></section><section class="section-project-details"><h3>The Engagement Program</h3><blockquote>Essentially, it's a concept that looks to integrate teachers, students, parents, schools, community members, stake holders, and local companies to bring pride back to being a member of a public school.<br><cite>Colin Chan</cite></blockquote><p>In addition to the school's new logo, I worked with Chan on a program that would instill in students a sense of public school pride. As many students were being drawn to private schools with the allure of better education and extracurricular programs, the goal of the engagement program was to <strong>reinforce the sense of local community and pride</strong> that only public schools could offer.</p><p>Chan and I settled on the name <strong>Learn + Lead + Lift Up</strong>, because of its catchy alliteration as well as its focus on engagement outside the classroom. The aim was for students to recognize that learning was only the first part of what made public school great - they would also be counted on to lead and lift up others in the community. And of course, with a new name came a new logo, which I also designed.</p><figure class="container project-image"><div class="col-2of3"><a href="img/carnarvon-cougars/learn-lead-liftup-logo.png"><img src="img/carnarvon-cougars/learn-lead-liftup-logo.png" alt="The 'Learn + Lead + Lift Up' logo, featuring the title text as well as an L with a plus sign inside."></a></div><figcaption><div class="col-1of3"><h4>Learn + Lead + Lift Up Logo</h4><p>The Learn + Lead + Lift Up logo references the repeated 'L's and plus signs in the program's name, making it very clear what the logomark stands for.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p>Once the name and logo were finalized, I was tasked with creating a slide presentation that could be used to pitch the idea to parents at a Meet The Teacher Night. The ideology of the program was loaded, so I needed to make sure that both the slides were simple enough to not overwhelm the students or parents. I aimed to minimize wordiness and focus on brief descriptions of each component (Learn, Lead, Lift Up).</p><figure class="container project-image"><div class="col-2of3"><a href="img/carnarvon-cougars/learn-lead-liftup-slide.jpg"><img src="img/carnarvon-cougars/learn-lead-liftup-slide.jpg" alt="A slide in the Learn + Lead + Lift Up presentation, with a paragraph on leadership set over top of an image of Carnarvon Community School."></a></div><figcaption><div class="col-1of3"><h4>The Presentation</h4><p>The presentation needed to be minimal yet effective, so I designed one slide around each of the specific components of the program (Learn, Lead, Lift Up) and used a faint background image of Carnarvon Community School.</p></div></figcaption></figure><a class="button" href="files/LearnLeadLiftUp.pdf">View Presentation</a></section><section class="section-project-details"><h3>Results</h3><p>Both the new Carnarvon Cougars logo and the Learn + Lead + Lift Up program were instant hits with the students and staff, who now want to wear their Carnarvon school spirit on their literal sleeves. In response to this demand, I arranged the two logos onto t-shirts - the Carnarvon Cougars logo on the front, and the Learn + Lead + Lift Up logo on the upper back - which will soon be sold to students and staff. It's been pretty amazing to see my work go from a concept to a shirt that students and staff are paying to wear!</p><a href="img/carnarvon-cougars/carnarvon-cougars-tshirts.jpg" class="img-view-more"><img src="img/carnarvon-cougars/carnarvon-cougars-tshirts.jpg" alt="Front and back mockups of the soon-to-be-produced Carnarvon Cougars t-shirts."></a><div class="container"><div class="col-1of2"><a href="img/carnarvon-cougars/carnarvon-cougars-brand.png" class="img-view-more"><img src="img/carnarvon-cougars/carnarvon-cougars-brand.png" alt="Branding components of the Carnarvon Cougar, including the logo, font, and colours."></a></div><div class="col-1of2"><a href="img/carnarvon-cougars/learn-lead-liftup-brand.png" class="img-view-more"><img src="img/carnarvon-cougars/learn-lead-liftup-brand.png" alt="Branding components of Learn + Lead + Lift Up, including the logo, font, and colours."></a></div></div></section><section class="more-projects"><h3>More Projects!</h3><div class="container"><a href="vanvero.html"><figure class="project-preview col-1of2 col-1of2-sm"><img src="img/vanvero/vanvero-preview.png" alt="The Vanvero logo."><figcaption class="project-info"><p class="project-name">Vanvero</p><p class="project-type">Graphic Design, Branding</p></figcaption></figure></a> <a href="wallpaper-mario.html"><figure class="project-preview col-1of2 col-1of2-sm"><img src="img/wallpaper-mario/wallpaper-mario-preview.png" alt="A red desktop wallpaper featuring Paper Mario."><figcaption class="project-info"><p class="project-name">Wallpaper Mario</p><p class="project-type">Graphic Design</p></figcaption></figure></a></div></section><footer><div class="container"><div class="col-2of3 col-1of2-sm"><p>Made with love, semantic code, and IE9+ support.
