            <p>In July 2015, I had the honour of helping Carnarvon Community School redefine its identity. One of my key tasks was to <strong>redesign Carnarvon Community School's logo</strong> and update the look for a new generation, without abandoning the heritage of the old logo. I worked closely with Colin Chan, a teacher from Carnarvon Community School, at multiple points throughout the design process to ensure that my work stayed true to the vibrant Carnarvon Community School spirit.</p>

            <p>While working on the Carnarvon Cougars logo redesign, I also helped to design and brand the school's new <a href="learn-lead-liftup.html">Learn + Lead + Lift Up</a> program.</p>

            <h3>The Process</h3>
          </div>

          <div class="col-3of4">

            <p>The old logo was a cartoony cougar halfheartedly waving a flag - not exactly fitting for an exuberant, athletics-focused elementary school! I was tasked with bringing energy to the logo while staying true to the cougar mascot and the original yellow-and-maroon colour scheme. Given Carnarvon's <strong>strong athletics program,</strong> the prospective logo would likely become the focal point of school jerseys as well. To that end, I focused on redesigning an up-to-date school logo that could be purposed for sports teams as well.</p>

            <blockquote>I'd like to have the logo printed on a purple base in dark yellow and maroon similar to the current colour scheme. I'd like to make the logo more aggressive.<br/>
            <cite>Colin Chan, Carnarvon Community School teacher, on the design requirements for the logo</cite></blockquote>

              <figcaption>
                <p><strong>The Old Logo:</strong> This cartoony cougar didn't match the dynamic vibrancy of Carnarvon Community School. And yes, this was the highest resolution file that existed.</p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Firstly, I focused on <strong>aggressive, angular geometry</strong> to make the cougar more dynamic. I also subtly <strong>increased the vibrancy of the colour palette</strong> while still conforming to the classic yellow-and-maroon. Finally, I changed the font to <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/25541553/Ailerons-free-typeface">Ailerons</a>, a taller, more angular font that emphasized the cougar's aggressiveness. Every choice added up to a far more vicious, ready-to-pounce cougar that better represented the school's vibrancy, without totally abandoning the heritage of the original logo.</p>

              <figcaption>
                <p><strong>The New Logo:</strong> The new logo utilizes a more aggressive depiction of a cougar, more vibrant colours, and a more angular typeface to express the school's high energy.</p>

            <p>The new Carnarvon Cougars logo was an instant hit with the students and staff, who now want to wear their Carnarvon school spirit on their literal sleeves.</p>

            <p>An order of t-shirts has been sold to students and staff, with the Carnarvon Cougars logo on the front, and the <a href="learn-lead-liftup.html">Learn + Lead + Lift Up</a> logo on the upper back. It's been pretty amazing to see my work go from a concept to a shirt that students and staff are paying to wear!</p>
